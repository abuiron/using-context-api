# Context API Task

This project demonstrates the use of the **Context API** in a React application to manage and share state across components without the need to pass props manually at every level. The project showcases a clean and efficient way of managing global state in React.

## Live Demo

## Project Overview
The **Context API Task** project is focused on using the React Context API to create a shared state that can be accessed by multiple components within the application. This eliminates the need for prop drilling and makes the application more scalable and maintainable.

## Key Features
- **Global State Management**: Using the Context API to manage state globally across components.
- **Component Interaction**: Components are able to share data and interact without having to pass props through multiple levels.
- **Provider and Consumer Setup**: Context Provider supplies data, and consumers (components) access this data wherever needed.
- **User Interface**: The UI is simple yet demonstrates the effective use of the Context API in handling state.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Deployment**: Netlify
